# Enterprise Product Feedback Loop

A framework for steering feedback from customers → GTM → Product → Engineering → back to customers.

## Live Demo

**[View the Framework](https://joannapedrina.github.io/product-feedback-loop/)**

## What This Covers

### The Flow
Customer feedback → GTM team (Sales/CS) → Product triage → Engineering build → Close the loop back to customers

### Key Sections

1. **By Audience** - What Leadership, PMs, Engineers, and Sales/Marketing each need to see
2. **Segmentation** - Slicing enterprise customers by industry, use case, region, tier, lifecycle
3. **Feedback Types** - Taxonomy: general feedback, requests, bugs, pain points, behavioral signals
4. **Models & Products** - Tracking feedback by model (Large, Small, Codestral) and product (API, Le Chat, betas)
5. **Automations** - Where to implement automations using Slack, Salesforce, Notion, Linear, GitHub
6. **Implementation** - How to roll this out and get buy-in from stakeholders
7. **Discovery Tools** - Supporting PMs in understanding what to build next
8. **Targeted Collection** - Time-based and usage-based feedback maturity, plus organic collection methods

## Core Philosophy

### Don't Survey - Collect Organically

Customers are constantly sharing feedback—just not in survey form:
- Shared Slack channels
- Sales & CS call notes (Granola transcripts)
- Error moments in the product
- Support tickets
- Renewal conversations
- Behavioral signals (usage drops, feature abandonment)

### Feedback Matures Over Time

- **Day 7**: What's confusing?
- **Day 30**: What's frustrating?
- **Day 120**: What's limiting?
- **Day 365+**: What keeps them here?

### Usage-Based Maturity

- **1st use**: Is it obvious?
- **20th use**: What slows them down?
- **50th use**: What are the limits?
